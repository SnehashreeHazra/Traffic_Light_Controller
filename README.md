# Project Name: Traffic_Light_Controller

# Title
FPGA and Arduino-Based Traffic Light Controller

# Aim
The project is aimed at designing a density based dynamic traffic signal system where the timing of signal will change automatially on sensing the traffic density at any junction. Traffic congestion is severe problem in most cities across the world and therefore it is time to shift more manual mode or fixed timer mode to an automated system with decision making capabilities.

# Problem Statement
With increasing traffic density and accidents at intersections, there is a need for intelligent and real-time traffic light controller that can accurately detect vehicles and dynamically adjust signal timings to improve traffic management and safety.
